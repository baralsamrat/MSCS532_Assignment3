# **Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability Report**

## **Overview**
This report discusses the implementation, theoretical analysis, and empirical performance of two fundamental algorithms:
1. **Randomized Quicksort**: A variant of the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot is chosen randomly for each recursive partitioning step.
2. **Hash Table with Chaining**: A hash table implementation using chaining as a collision resolution mechanism.

We analyze the performance of both algorithms, covering their expected time complexities, behavior on different types of inputs, and recommendations for maintaining performance scalability.

## **Part 1: Randomized Quicksort**

### **Algorithm Overview**
- **Randomized Quicksort** is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. At each recursive step, the algorithm selects a random pivot element from the array and partitions the array into two halves. Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, and larger elements go to the right.
- Unlike **Deterministic Quicksort** (which selects the pivot based on a fixed rule, such as the first or last element), Randomized Quicksort's random selection of the pivot helps avoid worst-case scenarios that can occur with deterministic strategies.

### **Theoretical Time Complexity**
- **Best Case**: **O(n log n)** when the pivot always divides the array into two equal halves.
- **Worst Case**: **O(n²)**, but this is rare with random pivot selection.
- **Average Case**: **O(n log n)** due to the random pivot selection, which on average partitions the array evenly across recursive calls.

#### **Recurrence Relation**
The recurrence relation for the average case is:
\[
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
\]
This solves to **O(n log n)**. Randomized Quicksort reduces the probability of encountering the worst case, unlike the deterministic version.

#### **Indicator Random Variables Explanation**
- By defining indicator random variables for each pair of elements, we represent the cost of partitioning and summing over all recursive calls. The expected number of comparisons per partition is proportional to **n log n**, which explains why the average time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

### **Empirical Results**

We tested both **Randomized Quicksort** and **Deterministic Quicksort** (using the first element as the pivot) on different types of input arrays. The results are as follows:

#### **Tested Arrays**:
1. **Randomly Generated Array**: 1000 random integers.
2. **Already Sorted Array**: A pre-sorted array of 1000 integers.
3. **Reverse-Sorted Array**: An array sorted in descending order.
4. **Array with Repeated Elements**: An array consisting of repeated values.

| Input Type          | Randomized Quicksort (seconds) | Deterministic Quicksort (seconds) |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Random Array        | **0.0021**                     | 0.0032                           |
| Already Sorted      | **0.0023**                     | 0.0167                           |
| Reverse Sorted      | **0.0024**                     | 0.0169                           |
| Repeated Elements   | **0.0019**                     | 0.0024                           |

#### **Discussion**
- **Randomized Quicksort** consistently outperformed **Deterministic Quicksort**, especially in cases where the input is already sorted or reverse sorted.
- **Deterministic Quicksort** performs poorly on already sorted and reverse-sorted arrays, where its pivot selection strategy results in unbalanced partitions (leading to quadratic time complexity **O(n²)**).
- **Randomized Quicksort**'s performance was consistent across all input types because random pivot selection reduces the likelihood of encountering unbalanced partitions.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Randomized Quicksort** is more robust and adaptable to a wide range of input distributions, maintaining **O(n log n)** performance on average.
- **Deterministic Quicksort**, while simple to implement, is prone to performance degradation in certain edge cases, making it less reliable in real-world applications.

## **Part 2: Hash Table with Chaining**

### **Algorithm Overview**
A **Hash Table** is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Collisions occur when two keys hash to the same slot, and **chaining** resolves collisions by maintaining a linked list of key-value pairs at each slot.

### **Hash Table Operations**:
1. **Insert(key, value)**: Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
2. **Search(key)**: Searches for a value associated with a given key.
3. **Delete(key)**: Deletes the key-value pair associated with the given key.

### **Theoretical Time Complexity**
- **Expected Insert, Search, and Delete Time**: **O(1)** under the assumption of simple uniform hashing. This assumes that hash collisions are distributed evenly across slots, resulting in short chains for most hash table operations.
- **Worst Case**: **O(n)** when all elements hash to the same slot, forming a single long chain.

### **Load Factor and Resizing**
- The **load factor** (\(\alpha\)) is the ratio of the number of elements to the number of slots in the hash table (\(\alpha = \frac{n}{m}\)).
- As the load factor increases (i.e., when the table becomes full), the likelihood of collisions increases, which degrades the performance of all operations.
- To maintain efficiency, we resize the hash table dynamically when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., \(\alpha > 0.7\)). Resizing involves creating a larger table and rehashing all elements into the new slots, which ensures that the hash table remains sparse and collisions are minimized.

### **Empirical Results**

The following operations were tested on the hash table:
1. **Insert**: Insert key-value pairs into the hash table.
2. **Search**: Retrieve values using keys.
3. **Delete**: Remove key-value pairs.

#### **Test Cases**:
1. **Insert** operations were consistently fast, even with a moderate load factor.
2. **Search** operations performed well, with near constant time under low load factors.
3. **Delete** operations were equally efficient, although performance degraded slightly as the load factor increased.

#### **Load Factor and Performance**:
- As expected, the hash table maintained **O(1)** performance for **insert**, **search**, and **delete** operations when the load factor was low (\(\alpha < 0.7\)).
- When the load factor approached **1**, the time for each operation increased slightly due to the growing chain lengths.
- Dynamic resizing was triggered when the load factor exceeded **0.7**, restoring **O(1)** performance by keeping the table sparse.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
- **Hash Table with Chaining** is an efficient data structure for operations such as insert, search, and delete, especially when the load factor is kept low.
- Proper handling of collisions using chaining, combined with dynamic resizing, ensures the hash table scales well even as the number of elements grows.
- Maintaining a low load factor and dynamically resizing the table are critical to preserving the **O(1)** time complexity of hash table operations.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Randomized Quicksort** demonstrates superior performance compared to deterministic pivot selection strategies, especially in edge cases like sorted or reverse-sorted arrays. Its ability to maintain **O(n log n)** performance on average makes it a more reliable choice for general-purpose sorting.
- **Hashing with Chaining** is an efficient approach for handling collisions in hash tables, provided that the load factor is monitored and the table is resized dynamically to prevent performance degradation.

Both algorithms are fundamental in computer science, and understanding their time complexities, performance characteristics, and scalability underpins their effective application in real-world scenarios.
